/*
In the given code snippet, `StringConfig._()` is a private constructor with the underscore prefix. The purpose of using `._()` is to prevent the class from being instantiated from outside of the class itself.

By convention, when a constructor is marked as private using the underscore prefix, it means that the class cannot be instantiated directly from outside the class. In this case, `StringConfig._()` ensures that the `StringConfig` class cannot be instantiated using the `new` keyword or by calling the constructor directly.

This technique is often used when you want to create a class that should not be instantiated but provides only static members or utility methods. By making the constructor private, you enforce that the class can only be accessed through its static members or methods.

For example, you might have other static methods or properties defined within the `StringConfig` class that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. By making the constructor private, you ensure that the class is used as intended, without unnecessary instantiation.

Here's an example of how you could use the `StringConfig` class with a private constructor:

dart
class StringConfig {
  StringConfig._();

  static String getApiKey() {
    return 'your_api_key';
  }

  static String getBaseUrl() {
    return 'https://api.example.com';
  }
}

void main() {
  String apiKey = StringConfig.getApiKey();
  String baseUrl = StringConfig.getBaseUrl();

  print('API Key: $apiKey');
  print('Base URL: $baseUrl');
}
In this example, the private constructor ensures that the `StringConfig` class cannot be instantiated. However, you can still access its static methods (`getApiKey()` and `getBaseUrl()`) to retrieve the desired values.
