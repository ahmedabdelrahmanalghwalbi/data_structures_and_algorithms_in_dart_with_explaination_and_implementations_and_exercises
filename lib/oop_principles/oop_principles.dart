1- Data Hiding :-
---------------
In OO terminology, data is referred to as attributes, and behaviors are referred to as methods.
Restricting access to certain attributes and/or methods is called data hiding.
By combining the attributes and methods in the same entity, which in OO parlance is
called encapsulation.

2- Getters and Setters :-
----------------------
The concept of getters and setters supports the concept of data hiding. Because other objects
should not directly manipulate data within another object, the getters and setters provide
controlled access to an objectâ€™s data. Getters and setters are sometimes called
accessor methods and mutator methods, respectively.

3- Modeling Tools :-
------------------
Visual modeling tools provide a mechanism to create and manipulate class diagrams using
the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

4- What Exactly Is a Class?
--------------------------
In short, a class is a blueprint for an object.When you instantiate an object, you use a class
as the basis for how the object is built.
Note :- Classes Are Object Templates.

5- Access Designations
-----------------------
When a data type or method is defined as public, other objects can directly access it.
When a data type or method is defined as private, only that specific object can access it.
Another access modifier, protected, allows access by related objects,


6- Methods:-
-----------
methods implement the required behavior of a class.

7- Messages
-----------
Messages are the communication mechanism between objects.
